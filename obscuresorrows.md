title: Obscure sorrows
---

Inspired by John Koenig's _Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows_.


*_Malm_*, n. The realization that most of the greatness in the world will forever
go unrecognized — that while civilization televises its triumphs, geniuses
and prodigies in tribes and ghettos will go on shining invisibly, like
diamonds an inch below the surface in a mine.

*_Flostrum_*, n. The state of unease in the moments following a missed
opportunity, characterized by the slowly fading deliberation of whether it is
too late to turn back and square the picture, to give the bum some change, to
stand up for a friend, or to offer an apology.

*_Gleiss_*, n. The solace educed by viewing a work of art that is characterized
not by the aesthetic quality of the result, but by the amount of time that
went into producing it — reassurance that amid the frenzied clamor of the
day there abide a focused few of steady discipline, like placid palm trees at
ease in the eye of a storm.

*_Whurlow_*, n. The vertigo of intuition that accompanies a sudden twist of temper
toward the view that the world is mere chaos on which we naïvely impose our
hopes and fears, that truth is no more than collective agreement on a
Rorschach test, and that arguing over meaning is like quarreling about what
shapes the stars really make.

*_Premourie_*, n. The desire to skip past acquaintanceship and dive deep straight
into companionship and intimacy, knowing that others too are bored of the idle
chat somehow necessary to buy the trust of a friend, the casual handshake of
cautious formality culturally expected to precede true embrace.

*_Janz_*, n. Awareness of the precariousness of every social context, each board
meeting and private rendezvous a delicate maneuver of tones and gestures
requiring the balance of a tightrope walker, sensitive rituals in which the
contraction of the wrong muscle may throw off the entire dance.
